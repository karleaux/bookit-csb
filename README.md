# Bookit

BookIt was a proof-of-concept for a freelancing platform similar to [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) where users can create accounts, post services (called **Talents**) they can render to others, and avail of the services of other users. The platform was geared towards those working in the creatives field (e.g. art, literature, design, etc.)

It was a web app built on [Laravel 7](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/releases) and [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) for the purposes of accomplishing a college Web Development class.

[You can view a live demo of the app here](https://bookit-csb.herokuapp.com/).

> The app was built by then-students @karleaux, @jose-bamboo, @tmunoz200168 and @nardude
